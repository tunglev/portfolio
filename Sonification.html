                    <h2>Research Objective</h2>
                    <p>This study investigates the optimal audio encoding methods for spatial information to enhance environmental awareness
                        through sound. The research specifically focuses on developing and evaluating different approaches to convey
                        room-scale spatial information through audio cues, enabling users to understand their surroundings without visual
                        input.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Experimental Setup</h2>
                    <p>The study utilizes wired headphones in a controlled indoor environment to ensure consistent motion controller
                        tracking and audio quality. The testing environment consists of randomly selected preset rooms within a 12x12 foot
                        boundary, incorporating a safety guard offset of 1-2 feet. This setup enables controlled testing while maintaining
                        ecological validity.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The research employs a comprehensive testing protocol divided into pre-test qualification and main test phases. The
                        pre-test phase evaluates subjects' basic spatial audio perception abilities through various tasks, including
                        pointing to static and moving audio sources in both 2D and 3D space. The main test phase involves three distinct
                        scenarios: Stationary, Line, and Studio, where subjects navigate virtual environments and interact with objects
                        using different audio encoding methods.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Audio Encoding Methods</h2>
                    <p>Two primary encoding approaches were developed, each with three distinct variations:
                        1) Growing Sphere Method: Features time-based distance indication with three variations: basic timing,
                        pitch-distance mapping, and pitch-elevation mapping.
                        2) Environmental Sound Method: Implements three different approaches to wall and object sonification: sequential
                        sound emission, constant sound emission, and on-demand sound emission (echolocation-style).</p>

                    <h2>Spatial-Audio Mapping</h2>
                    <p>The study explores various mappings between spatial properties (distance, elevation) and sound properties (pitch,
                        delay, amplitude). Multiple mapping configurations are investigated, including direct one-to-one relationships and
                        more complex transformations. For example, specific implementations include mapping elevation to frequency (6000Hz
                        for high elevation with +10dB amplitude, adjusted accordingly for lower elevations) and various distance-to-sound
                        parameter relationships.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                    <p>Preliminary results demonstrate that in stationary testing conditions, subjects exhibited approximately twice the
                        accuracy in horizontal position determination compared to vertical position identification when utilizing Meta's
                        native HRTFs. This indicates a significant disparity in spatial audio perception between horizontal and vertical
                        planes.</p>

                    <h2>Impact and Applications</h2>
                    <p>This ongoing research holds substantial potential for assistive technology, enabling enhanced independent spatial
                        navigation for visually impaired individuals through intuitive auditory feedback, as well as safety applications
                        providing supplementary spatial awareness systems with 360-degree environmental perception. The research continues
                        to progress, with implications for both assistive technology development and broader applications in spatial
                        awareness enhancement.</p>
